**HR Insights & Employee Attrition Dashboard – Power BI**
This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI to help organizations understand and visualize employee attrition patterns based on multiple key
factors. The dashboard provides clear, data-driven insights that support HR teams in identifying the root causes of employee turnover and making informed decisions to improve 
retention.

**📌 Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to analyze HR data and uncover patterns that contribute to employee attrition. The dashboard delivers a comprehensive view of workforce trends and 
helps answer questions like:
1) Which departments experience the highest attrition?
2) How does age, salary, education, and job satisfaction impact employee turnover?
3) What job roles are most affected by attrition?
4) Is attrition higher among males or females?
5) How does years at the company influence retention?
The dashboard is designed with a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for HR managers and leadership teams to explore insights with just a few clicks.

**🔍 What This Dashboard Does**
1)  Visualizes employee attrition trends across Age, Education, Department, Gender, Salary, Years at Company, and Job Role.
2)  Highlights key KPIs such as total employees, attrition rate, average salary, and job satisfaction metrics.
3)  Allows HR teams to identify high-risk groups and potential areas of concern.
4)  Helps organizations make data-backed decisions to improve retention strategies.
5)  Provides detailed filters and drill-down options for deeper analysis.
